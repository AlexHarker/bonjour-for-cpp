Bonjour for C++
===============

A lightweight header-only library for Bonjour service discovery and advertising.

* Bonjour for C++ allows browsing and registering of services, as well as service resolution.
* It makes use of the low-level DNS Service Discovery API, making it suitable for cross-platform work.
* It is currently only tested on Mac OS and IOS.

Getting started:
---------------------------------
- Include include/bonjour-for-cpp.hpp (this includes all other required headers) 
- Try the bonjour_peer class which allows service discovery, advertising and resolution in one simple object
- You can also use lower-level constructs (bonjour_register / bonjour_browse / bonjour_service) if required.
